  - I am not the wolf! I know he swapped out those numbers! I knew it was 15. One
    after 14. As if I could ever make such a mistake.
  - Never. Never! I just - I just couldn't prove it. He - he covered his tracks,
    he got that idiot in the bushes to lie for him.
  - You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This sheepcanery? He's
    done worse.
  - That cardboard cutout! Are you telling me that a sheep just happens to fall like
    that? No! He orchestrated it! Really Tall Sheep!
  - He was stuck up in the clouds! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. I took
    him into my own grassy knoll! What was I thinking?
  - He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same!
    Couldn't keep his hooves out of the hay bale!
  - But not our Tally! Couldn't be precious Tally! Stealing them blind! And he gets
    to be a sheep!? What a sick joke!
  - I should've stopped him when I had the chance! And you - you have to stop him!
