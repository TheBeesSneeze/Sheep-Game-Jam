  - alas. you have caught me.
  - for you, this was all a game
  - but this was everything for me.
  - i had no ill intentions towards any of the sheep in this pasture
  - i merely wanted to fit in
  - you may just see sheep, dog.
  - but to me. i see bretheren.
  - i will leave without a fuss. i understand i am unwelcomed here.
  - 'i shall return to my shelter.

  - goodbye forever.
